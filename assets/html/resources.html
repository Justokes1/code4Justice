                in the correspondence study arena, we have put together what we feel to be the

                Once inmates are released, obtaining a form of identification like a driver's license 
                is critical. It enables them to make productive steps toward the future, such as opening 
                bank accounts and getting jobs. If your ID has lapsed, visit your DMV as soon as possible 
                for a new one. This seemingly mundane task will make everyday life so much easier. </p>

                The process of previously incarcerated youth transitioning from juvenile justice residential placement back 
                into their communities is an exciting and significant step, yet it can also be a difficult one. Young people 
                leaving residential placement face many concerns as they reenter the community, home, and school/workforce. 
                Reentry refers to those activities and tasks that prepare youth placed out of home for reentry into their 
                families and communities.
